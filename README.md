ATM Simulation Project
Implemented in C language using CodeBlocks IDE

Introduction
This project presents a simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system, demonstrating basic banking operations such as cash withdrawal, balance enquiry, and PIN validation using C programming language.

Objectives
To simulate basic ATM functionalities using C language.
To understand procedural programming concepts and user input handling.
To demonstrate secure PIN authentication and transaction processing.

Problem Statement
Traditional banking transactions can be time-consuming and may require physical presence. The project addresses the need to provide a simulated interactive ATM interface to demonstrate how such systems operate efficiently.

Proposed Solution
Develop a console-based ATM simulation program in C language that allows users to perform secure transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, and balance checks with PIN authentication.

System Architecture
The system consists of modules for user authentication, transaction processing, and balance management, interacting through a command-line interface to simulate real ATM behavior.

Methodology
Using procedural programming, the system employs functions for modularity, uses control structures for logical flow, and handles user input/output for seamless interaction.

Components Used
C Programming Language
CodeBlocks IDE
Standard Input/Output
Control Structures (if/else, loops)
Functions and File Handling

Results
The project successfully simulates key ATM functions such as PIN verification, balance inquiry, and cash withdraw. It offers a user-friendly console interface demonstrating these operations effectively.

Limitation
Being a console based simulation, it lacks graphical user interface and real-time hardware integration. It supports only one user session at a time and does not interact with actual banking databases.

Future Scope
Enhancing with GUI for better user experience.
Connecting to real databases for live transaction handling.
Incorporating multi-user support and networking features.
Security improvements like encryption and multi-factor authentication.
